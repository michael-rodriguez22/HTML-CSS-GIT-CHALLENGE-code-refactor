# Code Refactor
This coding challenge is intended to simulate an on the job ticket. I was tasked with refactoring a company's landing page to meet accessibility standards. This challenge is an exercise in basic HTML, CSS, and Git proficiency.

Starter code was cloned from <a href="https://github.com/coding-boot-camp/urban-octo-telegram">here.</a>

Functional, refactored page is viewable by clicking <a href="https://mikeyrod22.github.io/HTML-CSS-GIT-CHALLENGE-code-refactor/">here.</a>
