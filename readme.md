# Code Refactor
This challenge was intended to simulate an on the job ticket. I was tasked with refactoring a mock landing page to meet accessibility standards and remove redundant / flawed code. The starter code was cloned from <a href="https://github.com/coding-boot-camp/urban-octo-telegram">here.</a>

Deployed site is viewable <a href="https://michael-rodriguez22.github.io/HTML-CSS-GIT-CHALLENGE-code-refactor/">here</a>. Enjoy!
